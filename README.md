# My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They're here for everyone to steal if desired, I don't mind.

I use dotbot to install where possible but there are some machines that don't support it (they don't belong to me unfortunately), so there's a separate install script under bin/ that does the work too.

I don't make changes every day but it is fairly active. If you have any questions or anything like that create an issue or toss me an email or whatever and I'll help where I can!
